# Projects for ECE-3873 from Spring 2020
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, my lab class moved online after partnered labs had finished, but before projects were completed. Due to this, projects were completed in multisim. In this directory you will find my two independent projects from Spring 2020.


## Robot Project
The 2020 electronics lab robotics challenge focused on designing a robot that would be able to travel down a hallway in the engineering building, Carson.  The robot would travel down the corridor by “bouncing” as it completed turns between the two walls with the goal of making as many turns as possible. After reaching a marked distance down the hall, the robot would be switched from automatic mode to a manual controlled mode.  In a manual control state, the robot would be steered over a bonus target and driven into one of several destination slots.  At the end of the run, the robot would then shut off its motors and blink a LED signaling completion of the course.

## Independent Project
Amplified Racing is a cardriving game simulated on an analog computer featuring a road course created with an integrator circuit and indicators of whether the car is on the road.  To simulate a car driving down a road, four different subcircuits are interconnected.
